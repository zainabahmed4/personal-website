# personal-website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my background, skills, and passions as a CS and Design student in Chicago. Here, you'll find a bit about me, projects I've worked on, and links to connect on GitHub and LinkedIn. I built and designed this site to highlight my journey and interests in web development and technology. Thanks for visiting!
